  description: " Noosa grown and Melbourne owned, Will Clift is not your average singer songwriter. His versatility, musical ability and passion is what makes his music unique. For the last 14 years, this lad has been busy on the rugby field leading him into the world of pro rugby union but now also taking the leap on to the quick paced and ever-changing Music scene with his latest single 'For You'.

Explicitly delivering smooth soul melodies destined for summer chillout sessions, ‚ÄòFor You‚Äô specifically will give you those chills as the sun sets on a hot summer day. It definitely is those silky vocals and the last-minute addition of live strings that producer Julian Steel brought to the table that complete the song.

‚ÄòFor You‚Äô was written after a road trip to Split Milk Festival in 2017, it pens a story of forbidden love and touches on a personal conflict between commitment and heart break.

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt had the best luck with relationships, honestly it was my fear of commitment and a mental tug of war that lead me to rethink my embedded perceptions and consider all the what if‚Äôs‚Äù

Will has spent the past 13 years mastering his craft in notable live music venues, charity events and city events. Such as the Night Cat, the Brunswick Hotel and the Carols on Kings 2014 ( in front of over 10,000 people.)

Will is currently writing new material whilst on the lookout for his new musical project.

With his inspirations from the likes of D‚ÄôAngelo and Tom Misch, Will is creating a concoction of warm and sentimental sounds, paving the way for his very own style of soulful R‚Äôn‚ÄôB to melt hearts all over globe.

There will be two versions of ‚ÄòFor You‚Äô out October 25th, along with an acoustic session video, filmed live from his Brunswick backyard with the company of a few good mates.
